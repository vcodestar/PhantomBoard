    <h1>Welcome to Phantom Board!</h1>

    <p>
        This forum is a side project that I created to provide a safe, anonymous space for open conversations. As part of my studies and personal interest in building meaningful web applications, I wanted to create a platform where users could interact without the fear of judgment, while prioritizing privacy and anonymity.

    <p>
        At <strong>Phantom Board</strong>, you can engage in discussions, ask questions, or share your thoughts freelyâ€”without revealing your identity. The platform is designed to foster respectful and open dialogue among users who value anonymity and the freedom to express themselves.
